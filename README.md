# ai-tictactoe (Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning)

A command-line Tic Tac Toe game where the AI uses the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning** to make optimal decisions.

## Features

- Human vs. AI gameplay
- AI uses Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning for efficiency
- Never loses if playing first
- Lightweight, runs in terminal
- Clean and well-structured code

## How It Works

The AI evaluates all possible moves using the Minimax algorithm and prunes branches that can't affect the final decision using Alpha-Beta pruning. This drastically reduces the number of recursive calls and speeds up decision-making.
